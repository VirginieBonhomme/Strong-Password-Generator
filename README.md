# Strong Password Generator

I created the **Strong Password Generator** to make secure, work-appropriate passwords easy for anyone to generate. This web app has a clean, intuitive interface that follows cybersecurity best practices, encouraging employees to craft passwords that are both strong and memorable. I focused on a seamless UX/UI to engage users and make the process of creating secure passwords quick and straightforward. Designed to meet industry standards for complexity and security, this tool is ideal for individuals and teams looking to improve their digital safety in the workplace.
